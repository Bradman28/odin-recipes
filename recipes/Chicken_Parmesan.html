    <p class="align">
        Chicken Parmesan is one of my favorite comfort foods. It is great along side pasta, and fun to make homemade marinara as well!

    </p>

    <p class="align"> 
        I have found that this recipe works best with all fresh ingredients. Don't be afraid to buy higher quality mozzarella and herbs, as well as marinara from scratch.
